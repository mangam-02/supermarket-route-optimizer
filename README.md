# Multi-Criteria Optimization for Shopping Lists in Supermarkets

![Pareto Evolution](src/assets/pareto_evolution.gif)

## Description

This project is part of the course “Multi-Criteria Optimization and Decision Analysis for Embedded Systems Design” at TUM. It implements algorithms for optimizing shopping lists in a simulated supermarket grid and considers multiple objective functions simultaneously (e.g., distance, weight, hardness).

## Installation und Requirements

### Voraussetzungen
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

### Abhängigkeiten
Installiere die Abhängigkeiten mit:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setup
1. Repository klonen oder entpacken
2. Virtuelle Umgebung aktivieren (optional):
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Abhängigkeiten installieren (s.o.)
```

## Description

This repository contains code for multi-criteria optimization of shopping lists in a simulated supermarket grid. It was developed for the course "Multi-Criteria Optimization and Decision Analysis for Embedded Systems Design" (TUM). The goal is to find product pickup orders that balance multiple objectives such as travel distance, stacking/weight constraints, and product hardness.

## Installation and Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

### Dependencies
Install required Python packages with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setup
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. (Optional) Activate a virtual environment:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies as shown above.
4. Start Jupyter Notebook if you want to run the notebooks interactively:

```
jupyter notebook
```

## Notebooks and Examples
Key notebooks located in `src/`:
- `optimization_1d.ipynb`
- `optimization_2d.ipynb`  (contains simulated annealing and Pareto visualizations)
- `optimization_3d.ipynb`
- `create_shopping_lists.ipynb`
- `create_supermarket_grid.ipynb`

To run: open the notebook and execute cells in order. `optimization_2d.ipynb` demonstrates 2D optimization (distance vs. weight) and plotting utilities.

## Data
- Supermarket grids: `src/supermarket-grids/grid.txt`, `src/supermarket-grids/grid_eng.txt`
- Shopping lists: `src/shopping-lists/Long_shopping_list.txt`, `src/shopping-lists/small_shopping_list.txt`

## Algorithms and Methods

- A* for pathfinding inside the grid
- GRASP and greedy heuristics for generating biased initial orders
- Local search (swap operations) for neighborhood exploration
- Evolutionary algorithms with Pareto ranking and crowding distance to maintain diversity
- Hypervolume calculation to assess Pareto-front quality

## Visualization

- 2D Pareto plots (Distance vs Weight)
- 3D Pareto plots (Distance vs Weight vs Hardness)
- Path visualization inside the supermarket grid
- Hypervolume plots for convergence analysis
